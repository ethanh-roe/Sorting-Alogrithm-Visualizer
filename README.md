Initially, this project was something I made in highschool for the final project for my APCS class. Since then, I have learned a lot about programming and design of programs. I decided to remake the program from scratch as the original project was very messy and unorganized. This program aims to demonstrate how different sorting algorithms work visually. 

To try the app, download the latest release from the [releases tab](https://github.com/ethanh-roe/Sorting-Alogrithm-Visualizerizer/releases/tag/v1.0)
Java version 16 or later is required to run the app.
